## What I Build

### Simple Websites for Local Businesses
- **Cafe & Restaurant Websites** - Menu, location, contact, reservations
- **Small Business Landing Pages** - Services, testimonials, contact form
- **Local Service Provider Sites** - Plumbers, electricians, contractors
- **Local Tourism Pages** - Guides, attractions, booking links
- **Simple E-commerce** - Small product stores with checkout

### Full-Stack Web Applications
- **React/Next.js Frontend** - Modern, responsive user interfaces
- **Node.js/Express Backend** - Scalable APIs and server-side logic
- **PostgreSQL Databases** - Relational data management
- **Authentication & Security** - JWT, RBAC, secure access
- **Admin Dashboards** - Data visualization and management

## Why Local Businesses?

I've built websites for small businesses because I understand their challenges:
- **Limited budgets** - Affordable packages, not enterprise pricing
- **Simple needs** - Focus on what actually matters (calls, bookings, sales)
- **Local focus** - 24/7 availability, local support, phone calls
- **Quick turnaround** - Turnaround times from 24-48 hours for urgent fixes

## My Process

1. **Understand your needs** - 30-minute call to discuss your business and goals
2. **Design & plan** - Simple, clean design that matches your brand
3. **Build & test** - Code that works, test thoroughly
4. **Launch & support** - Go live with confidence, I'm here to help
